Prince William forset park has a great compass orienteering course.  The park will provide you with maps that can be used to go off trail through the forest to locate numbered posts.  They don't currently provide the information to allow you to do the course via GPS.  This data allows you to do that on your own.  It is not complete, it is only based on posts I have visited.
